# Iptsemi
School project

Opening this project will require Mysql and Xampp.

This is an upload of my sample website. The database used by the sample is stored in a folder inside of the zip file.
Import the sql database file to Mysql via phpmyadmin, and the rest of the files to C:/xampp/htdocs.

The website can be accessed by turning on Xampp and entering the url: localhost/Aranguiz/Robin
